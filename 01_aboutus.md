# Need

Censorship is a major problem. See our presentation in "More" for details on the global effects of censorship. In terms of student censorship, the Tinker case initially ruled that school speech should not be censored unless it is disruptive, libelous, etc. However, in the Hazelwood case this decision was reversed school officials were given the ability to use prior restraint and retaliatory punishment. Only 9 states have laws which support the more free Tinker standard, and Virginia is not one of them. This was seen revently when a Fauquier County school blocked an article because it discussed marijuana.
